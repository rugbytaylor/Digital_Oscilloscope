# Digital_Oscilloscope
This is a personal project I have been working on to learn more about signal processing, embedded programming, and cirucit desgin. This was originally for use on the ECEN 330 controller, but planned for a custom embedded digital oscope. Can take an input of +5V to -4.5V with +-25mV accuracy. This project samples at a rate of 10kHz
